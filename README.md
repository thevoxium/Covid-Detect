# Detecting COVID-19 

I have experimented on various Deep Learning architectures to aid in classifying COVID-19. I also Studied the effect of various regularization techniques and optimizers like Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Adam/RMSProp on accuracy.The best Neural Network Architecture had 9 CNN layers and Dense layers which achieved an Accuracy Score of 94.84% on the test data.[![](Architecture)](normal_save.pth.png)
